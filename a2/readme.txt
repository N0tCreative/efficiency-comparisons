Description:
	each c file has its own main.
	to compile all just type make
	to execute either type ./p** ./directory/to/file
	or ./p**
	if no directory is included it defaults to ./data_1.txt for ./p1* and ./data_2.txt for ./p2*
	each p** are different ways to preform comparisons with better efficiencies (requires a text file with specific parameters)
	p1*'s are for looking for the amount of numbers out of position
	p2*'s are different ways of finding the hull of a given set of coordinates
	p11 uses brute force
	p12 uses divide and conquer
	p21 uses brute force
	p22 uses quickhull
